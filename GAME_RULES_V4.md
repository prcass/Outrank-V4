## Round Structure

### Phase 1: Challenge Selection & Pool Setup
- **Current player in turn order** chooses one of the 3 visible challenge cards
- **Scan challenge QR code** using validation app to confirm selection
- **Category Pool Management**:
  - If this category hasn't been played: Draw 6 tokens from matching bag to center
  - If this category was played before: Use existing pool for this category (may have fewer than 6)
  - If pool has fewer than 6 tokens: Refill from bag to bring back to 6
- Replace used challenge card with new one (maintain 3 visible challenges)

### Phase 2: Bidding
- Starting with challenge selector, bid number of tokens you can correctly rank
- **Available for ranking**: 
  - All unblocked tokens in center pool
  - Your 2 hidden tokens from the matching category only
- **Minimum bid**: 3 tokens
- **Maximum bid**: Up to 8 tokens (6 center + 2 hidden, if all available)
- Continue clockwise, each player must bid higher or pass
- Last remaining bidder wins the right to rank

### Phase 3: Blocking
- Non-winning players may place blocking chips on visible center tokens only
- Start with player in last place (or left of winner if tied)
- Each player may:
  - **Block**: Place one chip on one visible token in center
  - **Pass**: Save chips for later rounds
- **BLOCKING LIMIT**: Cannot reduce available tokens below the bid amount
- Hidden tokens cannot be blocked

### Phase 4: Ranking & Validation
**The Ranking Player:**
1. **Selects** exactly their bid number of tokens from:
   - Unblocked visible tokens from center
   - Their own 2 hidden tokens from the matching category

2. **Arranges** selected tokens in order according to challenge

3. **Validates** using smartphone app:
   - App already loaded the challenge from earlier scan
   - Scan token QR codes in ranking order
   - App displays SUCCESS or FAILURE instantly

### Phase 5: Resolution

**IF RANKING SUCCEEDS:**
- Ranker scores 1 point per token ranked
- Ranker takes ALL blocking chips that were used
- **Ranker adds all successfully ranked tokens to their hidden collection**
- Successfully ranked tokens removed from center pool for this category

**IF RANKING FAILS:**
- Ranker scores 0 points
- Each blocker scores 2 points AND takes their blocked token into their hidden collection
- Blockers keep their chips
- **All tokens used in failed ranking remain in center pool for this category**

### Phase 6: Cleanup
1. **Category Pool Management**: Current category's pool now reflects tokens removed/added
2. **Hidden Token Refill**: Players who used hidden tokens draw from appropriate category bag back to 2 per category
3. **Next Player**: Turn order advances clockwise
4. **New Round**: Return to Phase 1

## Category Pool System

### Pool Persistence
Each category maintains its own persistent pool throughout the game:

**Example Game Flow:**
- **Round 1 (Countries)**: Start with 6, end with 4 tokens in Country pool
- **Round 2 (Movies)**: Start with 6 fresh movie tokens  
- **Round 3 (Countries)**: Resume with same 4 country tokens from Round 1, refill to 6
- **Round 4 (Sports)**: Start with 6 fresh sports tokens
- **Round 5 (Countries)**: Continue with country pool from Round 3

### Pool Refill Rules
- Pools only refill when they drop below 6 tokens
- Refill draws from the appropriate category bag
- If category bag is empty, that category cannot be selected

## Set Collection System

### Token Sets
Each token belongs to 4 different sets. Examples:

**Country Token (Japan)**:
- Geographic: Asia-Pacific Nations
- Economic: G7 Countries  
- Population: 100+ Million People
- Geography: Island Nations

**Movie Token (The Godfather)**:
- Genre: Crime Drama

- Era: 1970s Films
- Legacy: Film Franchises

**Sports Token (Los Angeles Lakers)**:

- Conference: Western Conference
- History: Championship Winners
- Market: Major Market Teams

**Company Token (Apple)**:

### Set Scoring (Game End Only)
Sets are revealed and scored when game ends:
- **2 tokens** from same set: 1 point
- **3 tokens** from same set: 3 points
- **4 tokens** from same set: 6 points
- **5+ tokens** from same set: 10 points

**CRITICAL**: Individual tokens not in sets are worth 0 points at game end!

### Collection Strategy
- **Tokens in your collection are secret** until game end
- **Successfully ranked tokens** join your collection and can be used in future rounds
- **Blocked tokens** (when ranking fails) join blocker's collection
- **Risk vs. Reward**: Use collected tokens in future rankings for points, but risk losing them

## Game End

The game ends when any condition is met:
1. **Token Depletion**: Any category bag is empty and its pool cannot be refilled to 6
2. **Round Limit**: After 2x number of players rounds (min 6, max 12)
3. **Score Target**: First player reaches predetermined score (optional)

### Final Scoring
1. **Ranking Points**: All points earned during successful rankings
2. **Blocking Points**: All points from successful blocks (2 pts each)
3. **Blocking Chips**: 1 point per chip remaining
4. **Set Collection Bonuses**: Score all completed sets (major points!)
5. **Individual Tokens**: Worth 0 points (only sets provide end-game value)

**Winner**: Player with highest total score!

### Tiebreakers
1. Most completed 5+ token sets
2. Most total completed sets
3. Most owned tokens
4. Most ranking points earned during play
5. Shared victory

## Strategy Guide

### Challenge Selection Strategy
- **Match your hidden tokens** - choose categories where you have strong hidden tokens
- **Deny opponents** - avoid categories where opponents seem confident
- **Pool assessment** - consider how many tokens are available in each category's pool

### Bidding Strategy
- **Know your assets**: 6 visible + 2 hidden from matching category = up to 8 tokens
- **Hidden token advantage** - you know 2 tokens opponents cannot see or block
- **Conservative early** - save blocking chips for crucial moments
- **Aggressive late** - force opponents to exhaust their chips

### Blocking Strategy
- **Cannot block below bid** - bidders account for this protection
- **Target extremes** - block obvious highest/lowest values
- **Set disruption** - block tokens that might complete opponent sets
- **Chip conservation** - only 3 chips per game, use wisely

### Set Collection Strategy
- **Memory game** - track opponent collections throughout game
- **Diversification** - build multiple sets rather than focusing on one
- **Cross-category sets** - some sets span multiple token types
- **Timing collection** - balance immediate scoring vs. long-term set building

### Token Risk Management
- **Collected tokens can be reused** - but risk permanent loss if ranking fails
- **Hidden tokens are safest** - use for guaranteed set completion
- **Failed ranking leaves tokens available** - might return to you later
- **Calculate set values** - is the potential 10-point set worth risking a 6-point immediate score?
