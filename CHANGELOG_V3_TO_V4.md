# Outrank V3 ‚Üí V4 Changelog

## Version 4.0 - [In Development]

### Overview
V4 represents a major gameplay overhaul, replacing the complex bidding/blocking/ranking system with a streamlined draft-and-guess push-your-luck mechanic. The core set collection goal remains, but the path to building sets is now faster, more engaging, and involves continuous risk/reward decisions.

## Token Pool Management

### V3 Token Management:
- 6 center tokens
- 2 hidden per player
- Removed tokens replaced individually
- Blocking chips per player

### V4 Token Management:
- 13 tokens initial (1 center + 12 pool)
- All tokens visible
- Pool refilled to minimum 8 between rounds
- No chips

---

## Scoring Changes

### V3 Scoring:
- Ranking points: 1 per token ranked
- Blocking points: 2-6 per successful block
- End-game: Set bonuses (2-10 points) + 1 per owned token + 1 per remaining chip

### V4 Scoring:
**During Play:**
- **1 point per correct guess**: Immediate reward for each successful higher/lower call
- **1 bonus point**: Last player to pass in round
- **Cash out sets**: 2 tokens = 2pts, 3 tokens = 5pts, 4 tokens = 8pts (anytime on your turn)

**Turn Order:**
- **First Guesser privilege**: First player to pass OR guess wrong goes first next round

**Wrong Guess:**
- **Lose tokens** from this round (back to center pool)
- **Keep points** earned from correct guesses (KEY: separates points from tokens)

**End Game:**
- Only previously cashed points count
- Uncashed tokens = 0 points

---

## Set Collection Changes

### V3 Sets:
- Tokens collected passively (successful rankings, successful blocks)
- All sets scored at game end
- Multiple scoring paths

### V4 Sets:
- Tokens collected actively (correct guesses)
- Must cash out during game for points
- One token per set only
- Risk of losing uncashed tokens
